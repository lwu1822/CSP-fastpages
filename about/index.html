<p>Hi, and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>My name is Lily Wu. I’m a junior at Del Norte High School.</p>

<p>My interests are in STEM, including programming, cybersecurity, and math.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about learning, and I love to play around and explore code.</p>

<p><em>I don’t know if this is a good thing</em>, but I have a bad habit of falling down a rabbit hole as I look up what each code syntax does <em>specifically</em>.</p>

<p>9/2/2022: <em>Currently falling down the rabbit hole learning Jekyll and Liquid</em></p>

<p>I have some experience in C++, and am currently learning Python and Java.</p>
