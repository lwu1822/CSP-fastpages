## Subject

Since I'm in AP Stats, I decided to create a statistics quiz. 

## Questions
1. What is the mean of the following set of numbers: 5, 8, 9, 15, 16?
2. [Normal distribution picture]: What percent of data lies between one standard deviation of the mean?
3. A class of 30 students were surveyed on how many hours they sleep. The average was 7 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours. What percentage of students sleep less than 8 hours? 

## Design
My app consists of five screens: Homepage, questions 1-3, and the end screen. 

Below are some pictures of what the initial design looked like:

After the initial design, I made a few revisions, namely changing the font, adding buttons (originally, the user had to click the screen), and adding radio buttons for the multiple choice selection. 

An intermediate photo where I added a button:

## Coding

### Explanations of code

### Things I learned

The code I encountered in AppLab was new to me. I used the documentation [^1] very frequently.
