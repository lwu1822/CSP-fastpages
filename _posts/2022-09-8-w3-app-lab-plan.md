## Subject

Since I'm in AP Stats, I decided to create a statistics quiz. 

## Questions
1. What is the mean of the following set of numbers: 5, 8, 9, 15, 16?
2. [Normal distribution picture]: What percent of data lies between one standard deviation of the mean?
3. A class of 30 students were surveyed on how many hours they sleep. The average was 7 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours. What percentage of students sleep less than 8 hours? 

## Coding
