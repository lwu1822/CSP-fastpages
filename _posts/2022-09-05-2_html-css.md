I changed the theme from minima to **minimal**

Overall, the minimal theme looked pretty similar to the minima theme. However, there were some problems with the new theme. 

For some reason, when my window is maximized, the contents on the webpage are displayed incorrectly.

But when I shrink my window, the contents are fine.

I'm not sure why that is the case. Maybe if I have time, I'll look into it.

I reverted the theme back to minima. One thing that I did change though, was the background. I used Vunsh's [blog](https://vunsh.github.io/blogging/fastpages/jupyter/darkmode/2022/08/30/22-Darkmode.html) as a starting point and used his dark mode .scss as a base. Then, I changed the background color to a gradient using the `linear-gradient` command.
