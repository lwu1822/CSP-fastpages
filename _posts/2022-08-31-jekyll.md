While I was setting up my fastpages blog, I noticed this interesting line of code in `index.html`. 

![](images/index_html_code.png "image markdown code")

And I thought, *hey, this is interesting, what does `{{site.baseurl}}` do?**

After some [googling](https://www.google.com/), I found that `{{site.baseurl}}` wasn't something in Markdown. Turns out it's actually Jekyll syntax. 

So what does `{{site.baseurl}}` do?
